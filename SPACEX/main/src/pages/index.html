        <h1>What is SpaceX?</h1>
        <p>SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corporation) is a space transportation and aerospace manufacturer
            founded in 2002 by <strong> Elon Musk. </strong> Musk is also the CEO of electric car maker <sup>Tesla.
            </sup>And most
            recently, he
            entered a deal to purchase social networking site Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. After 18 months of
            development, SpaceX unveiled a delivery vehicle in 2006 under the name Dragon. It was soon followed with
            Falcon, which was designed to lift humans and cargo into orbit.

            SpaceX has been a disruptive force in the worldwide launch industry as its launch services are less
            expensive than many of its competitors. It works closely with NASA to deliver cargo supplies and astronauts
            to the International Space Station (ISS), as well as to launch satellites into Earth orbit.</p>
